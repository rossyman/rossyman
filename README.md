## Hi, I'm Ross 👋🏻👨🏻‍💻

I'm a website developer, designer and software engineer from Glasgow, Scotland. I currently work for [@jpmorganchase](https://github.com/jpmorganchase) and study at Strathclyde University. At the moment, I'm working on creating designs and websites over at [@thretclothing](https://github.com/thretclothing). I've been a developer for over 6 years now, 2 of which at a fortune-500 company 🎉
