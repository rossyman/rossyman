## Hi, I'm Ross 👋🏻👨🏻‍💻

I'm a website developer, designer and software engineer from Glasgow, Scotland. I currently work for [@jpmorganchase](https://github.com/jpmorganchase) and study at Strathclyde University. At the moment, I'm working on a bitbird concept website, more on this can be seen at: [@rossyman/bitbird-ng](https://github.com/rossyman/bitbird-ng) ✨🕊 I've been a developer for over 6 years now, 2 of which at a fortune-500 company 🎉
